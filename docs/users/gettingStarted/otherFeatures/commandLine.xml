<title>Command Line Options for Blue</title>

<para>To view the options that Blue has from the commandline, type
"blue --help".  After that, you should see information printed to the console.
Some of these flags are used by the Netbeans Platform that Blue is built upon.
The following are ones Blue uses itself:</para>

<screen>
  -c, --compile &lt;arg&gt;       
  -o, --output &lt;arg&gt;
</screen>

<para>The flags above allow for commandline compilation of a .blue project
into a CSD. Both flags must be set to work. An example of usage is:</para>

<screen>
blue -csomeFile.blue -ooutput.csd
</screen>

<para>This will use somefile.blue and produce output.csd. The generated CSD 
will use the Disk Render settings for the project.  Using the commandline
option for compiling .blue projects is useful for automating builds of projects
using a build system like Make, Rake, Ant, or other tool.</para>

<!--
<screen>
blue -j somePythonScript.py
</screen>

<para>This will interpet a python file using blue (having access to all of
blue's class libraries) you can use (this doesn't quite work on windows, a bug
in jython21).</para>
