<para>The Code Repository is where you edit the options that will come up from
the code popup (the popup menu that is accessible by rt-clicking on most of the
text areas in blue).</para>

<para>The Code Repository features a tree to organize your code. Rt-clicking on
a folder will give you options to add a new code group, remove the current 
group, or add a code snippet to the group.
</para>

<para>If you add either a code group or a code snippet it will be created with a
default name. To edit the name, double click on the group or snippet and the
area on the tree will change into a text field to edit the name.</para>

<para>To edit a snippet, simply click on the snippet in the tree and on the
right a text area will appear. In that text area, edit the text that is
associated with the code snippet.</para>

<para>When you are done editing your code repository, the next time you rt-click
on a text area, the code popup will reflect the changes you have made, including
any new code groups and snippets you've added.</para>
