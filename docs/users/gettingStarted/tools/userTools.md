User-Defined Tools {#userDefinedTools}
==================

Users may add their own tools which they may wish to call quickly from
Blue (i.e. a favorite soundFile editing program). Under \'Tools\',
select \'Manage Tools\' to add, edit, delete, or reorder your tools.
Allowable input here is \'tool name\' which will be used by Blue for
displaying on the tools menu, and \'command line\' which Blue will use
to run the program.
