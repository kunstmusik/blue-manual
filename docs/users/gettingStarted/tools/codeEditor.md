===========

Blue uses the Netbeans Code Editor library for editing code. The editor
is customized depending on where you are in the application, but there
are common features shared. Some things which are available are:

-   Syntax Highlighting

-   Code Completion (ctrl-space)

-   Line Numbering (enabled globally in program settings)

-   Popup Menu (use right-mouse click) with additional options

You can adjust colors, fonts, and other settings within Blue's Program
Options.
