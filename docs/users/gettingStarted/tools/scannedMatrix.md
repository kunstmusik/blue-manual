The Scanned Synthesis Matrix Editor tools allows for editing and
creating matrix files used by the Scanned Synthesis opcodes in Csound.

-   Using "New" will ask what size matrix to create.
-   For editing, click anywhere on the matrix. This will either turn on
    or turn off that square, setting the connection between the masses
    to either 1 or 0.
-   After editing, press "Save" to save out the matrix to a file.
-   You can also click the "Random" button to create a randomized
    matrix.
