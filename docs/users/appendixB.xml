          <para>Previously, if a BSBObject was set to have "Automation Allowed" but was not 
            itself automated, it would compile as a constant in the generated CSD.  As of 
            0.124.3, if a widget is made to allow automation, the Csound code that uses the 
            widget value must accept a k-rate signal, whether the API is used or not.</para>

            <para>If you have a project that rendered fine before 0.124.3 but afterwards 
            can not render due to problems with Csound complaining that "k-rate signals not
            allowed", then you will need to either set the problematic widgets to not allow automation or
            change the Csound code so that it will work with the generated k-rate signal.
