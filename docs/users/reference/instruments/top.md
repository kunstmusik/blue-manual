# Instruments

Blue instruments are a higher level construct than Csound instruments.
They are designed to allow encapsulating all dependencies together with
the instrument, thus allowing easy sharing of instruments between
projects. Blue instruments may use Csound ORC code,
User-Defined-Opcodes, and f-tables, and they may have a graphical user
interface.
