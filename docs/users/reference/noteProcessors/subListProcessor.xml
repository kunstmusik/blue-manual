<title>SubList Processor</title>
         
<para>Parameters: start, end</para>
         
<para>The SubListProcessor will cut out notes from the soundObject's generated
noteList. An example of it's use may be that you have a 12-tone row as
soundObject in the soundObject library, and you're using instances of it as the
basis of your work. You may only want to use notes 1-3 of the row, so you would
use the SublistProcessor with a start of 1 and an end of 3. </para>
         
<para>The SubListProcessor will cut out notes, then translate them to start at
the start of the soundObject, and then scale them so that they take up the duration
of the soundObject. If you had a five note soundObject with all notes have a
duration of 1 second, all starting one after the other, with the soundObject
starting at 0 seconds on the timeline, and if you used a SubListProcessor with
start of 1 and end of 4, you'd end up with four notes being generated(the first
four from the original soundObject), starting a 0 seconds on the timeline, with
each notes duration lasting 1.25 seconds, each starting one right after the
other.</para>

<para>The following score:</para>

<programlisting>
i1 0 2 1
i1 + . 2
i1 + . 3
i1 + . 4
</programlisting>

<para>when  processed with a SubList processor with start 2 and end 3, would result
in:</para>

<programlisting>
i1	0.0	1	2
i1	1.0	1	3
</programlisting>

<para>(The p2 and p3 times above are post-processing for a 2 second duration
soundObject with time behavior set to scale.)</para>
