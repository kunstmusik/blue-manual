<para>parameters: noteIndex</para>
         
<para>The RotateProcessor rotates the order of the notes, making the noteIndex
the first note. For example a noteIndex of 2 means "make the second note of the
notes generated the first, shifting the first note to the end". With a noteIndex
of 3, the following score:</para>

<programlisting>
i1 0 2 1
i1 2 2 2
i1 4 2 3
i1 5 2 4
i1 6 2 5
</programlisting>

<para>will become:</para>

<programlisting>
i1 0 2 3
i1 2 2 4
i1 4 2 5
i1 5 2 1
i1 6 2 2
</programlisting>

<para>As the third note now becomes the first. If a negative number is given,
the number will count backwards as to what note should now become the first
note. With a noteIndex of -2 (meaning, "Second note from the end"), the
following score:</para>

<programlisting>
i1 0 2 1
i1 2 2 2
i1 4 2 3
i1 5 2 4
i1 6 2 5
</programlisting>

<para>Will become:</para>

<programlisting>
i1 0 2 4
i1 2 2 5
i1 4 2 1
i1 5 2 2
i1 6 2 3
</programlisting>

<para>Start times of notes are all modified such that the notes that are pushed
to the end of list will start at the end time of the last note before it. For
the above examples, the duration of the note list ast a whole did not change at
all. However, when there are overlapping notes as in the following example,
where note index of -3 was used:</para>

<programlisting>
i1	0	5.0	0	4	
i1	2	5.0	1	4	
i1	4	5.0	2	4	
i1	6	5.0	3	4	
i1	8	5.0	4	4	
i1	10	5.0	5	4	
i1	12	5.0	6	4	
i1	14	5.0	7	4	
i1	16	5.0	8	4	
i1	18	5.0	9	4	
</programlisting>

<para>The resultant scores duration has changed as shown below:</para>

<programlisting>
i1	0.0	5.0	7	4	
i1	2.0	5.0	8	4	
i1	4.0	5.0	9	4	
i1	9.0	5.0	0	4	
i1	11.0	5.0	1	4	
i1	13.0	5.0	2	4	
i1	15.0	5.0	3	4	
i1	17.0	5.0	4	4	
i1	19.0	5.0	5	4	
i1	21.0	5.0	6	4	
</programlisting>

<para>Please be aware of this behavior when using this NoteProcessor with 
  scores that have overlapping notes.
