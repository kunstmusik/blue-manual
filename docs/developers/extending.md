# Extending Blue

## Introduction

Developers have a number of different methods for extending Blue. As
Blue is a modular application, built using the Netbeans Rich Client
Platform (RCP), any standard RCP module and suite can be added to Blue.
In conjuction with Blue's module's public APIs, this allows great
flexibility for a developer to add new modules to Blue.

Additionally, rather than adding completely new windows and pieces to
Blue, a developer may decide to create plugins to existing Blue
architectural pieces. The following sections discuss the various plugin
types and the steps to take to create your own plugin.

## Basics of Plugins

Blue Plugins come in various forms. In general, a plugin is a Java
Interface that has a number of implementations. Besides the
implementation of the plugin, plugins must be registered for them to be
discovered. The following discusses these various aspects in further
