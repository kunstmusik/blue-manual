    Blue is my tool for composing with Csound. I originally created it for its
    ability to organize SoundObjects in time as well as to organize and automate
    the more mundane tasks that I've found in working with Csound. It's here to
    make working with Csound a more enjoyable and focused experience.

    As the program develops over time I am finding more ways to make the user
    experience intuitive and the program faster to work with, as well as finding
    interesting new things to create to further the capacity for musical
    expression. The program's architecture is designed to be as open as possible
    in both things the user can do within Blue itself as well as the ability to
    expand Blue through the creation of plugins, and by taking advantage of both
    one can find many ways to create and shape musical ideas.

    Beyond my own ideas on where to go with Blue, user feedback has also greatly
    shaped the direction and richness of the program. Please feel free to email
    me anytime with feedback, or join the Blue mailing list and discuss your
    ideas and thoughts there.
