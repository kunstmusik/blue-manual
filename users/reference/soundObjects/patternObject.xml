<title>About the PatternObject</title>
<para>The PatternObject is pattern-based score editor, based on the author's
previous project "Patterns".  It is a flexible pattern-oriented score editor, 
useful for musical ideas which are pattern based, such as drum parts or 
minimalist-style musical ideas.</para>

<title>Setting PatternObject Properties</title>

<para>The PatternObject's Time Properties can be modified by clicking on the
button in the upper-right corner of the editor.  Clicking the button will 
hide or show the properties panel on the right, as shown below:

<para>Editing the time values will clear out any pattern triggers that the user
has entered.  It is recommended that one first decide the pattern time 
properties before working with the PatternObject.</para>

<title>Adding Patterns</title>

<para>To add Patterns to the PatternObject, use the "+" button on the bottom of 
the left hand section.  Double-clicking the name of the pattern name will allow 
editing of the name, and clicking on the [x] box will allow for muting the 
Pattern. Clicking on the Pattern in the table will also bring up it's score in 
the area below.

<title>Editing the Pattern's Score</title>

<para>The Pattern's score is standard Csound SCO text, with the same features 
supported as by the GenericScore SoundObject.  Each score should be started from
time zero. The Pattern's score should be set such that its score's total 
duration fits within the time of the subDivision. For example, if the properties
set for the PatternObject's time values are 4 beats and 4 subdivisions, each
beat is 1.0 in duration (corresponds to p3 value of a note) and thus a single 
subdivision in this case would be equivalent to .25. Scores shorter or longer
than the subdivision length are allowed, but one should be aware that the 
resultant score may or may not longer than what is visually represented on the
PatternObject score.
</para>

</simplesect>

<simplesect>
<title>Editing the PatternObject Score</title>

<para>The PatternObject score is visually edited by click on squares which 
correspond to subdivisions of the beat.  For example, if a Pattern's score 
is .25 in total duration, and the time value of the PatternObject is set to 4
and 4, then clicking a square would be to insert a 16th note in a score.
</para>

<para>To add to the PatternObject score, simply click on the square where one
wishes to have a Pattern triggered.  To remove, simply click on a selected
square.  The user can also click and drag to add or remove mutliple triggers.

  <listitem>
    <para>Users may be surprised at the generated score if time behavior is not 
    set to None(while others may prefer to use Scale, which is the default). 
    Please be mindful of this, especially when using PatternObjects and the
    SoundObject library, where the default for creating instances of 
    SoundObjects is to have Time Behavior of Scale on the Instance SoundObject.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>When the PatternObject is used with a Scale time behavior, you may not
    get the results you think you will get if the pattern is not filled in in 
    the last subdivision of the beat.  When Blue goes to generate a score for a
    soundObject, with a scale time behavior, the score is first generated, then 
    scaled to the duration of the soundObject.  So, if you're pattern has empty
    subdivisions and you're expecting there to be a space at the end of your 
    pattern, when you go to generate the CSD, the space won't be there.</para>
    
    <para>
    To get around this, you may want to use a time behavior of None, or you
    may want put in a "ghost note" in a Pattern layer,
    using a note like:

    <screen>
i 10000 0 .25
    </screen>
    
    Where 10000 is not an instrument in use in your project. Then you can put in
    a trigger for this pattern in the last subdivision.  What will happen is 
    that Blue will process the score with this note's time and thus will 
    generate with this out to the CSD, but Csound will ignore the note.
    
    </para>
    
    <para>
    When the PatternObject is set to use a time behavior of Repeat, the same 
    situation can occur as when using Scale if a Repeat Point is not set, as 
    the default for Repeat when no repeat point is set is to take the generated
    score and repeat it after the duration of the last note.  To prevent this,
    either use the ghost note technique above or set a repeat point.
