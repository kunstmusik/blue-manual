    <title>About the PianoRoll</title>
    <para>The PianoRoll SoundObject is a graphical tool to enter in notes, 
      commonly available in many MIDI sequencer environments. This PianoRoll is 
      unique in that it is Microtonal: it supports loading any 
      <ulink url="http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/">Scala</ulink> scale 
      file and editing of notes adapts to that scale.  For example, in the 
      picture above, the scale loaded is a Bohlen-Pierce scale with 13 tones to 
      the tritave. The PianoRoll above has adapted to that scale to show 13 
      scale degrees per octave of its editor. The generated notes can output 
      values as either frequency or PCH notation (octave.scaleDegree).  But 
      don't worry, if you're not interested in alternate tunings, the PianoRoll
      is set by default to use 12-TET tuning, the "standard" tuning system in 
      use today.

    <title>About Note Template Strings</title>
    <para>
      The PianoRoll uses Note Template strings as a way to maintain flexibility 
      and be able to handle the open-ended nature of Csound's instruments. Since the
      user who builds the instrument designs what each pfield will mean(besides p1,
      p2, and p3), the Note Template string should be made to match the instrument
      the user wants to use the PianoRoll with. When the note is generated, certain
      special text values (those enclosed in &lt; and &gt;) will be replaced by
      values unique to the note.
    </para>

    <para>For example, the following Note Template string:</para>

    <programlisting>
      i&lt;INSTR_ID&gt; &lt;START&gt; &lt;DUR&gt; &lt;FREQ&gt; 0 1 1
    </programlisting>

    <para>
      Will have the &lt;INSTR_ID&gt; replaced with the value set in the Piano Roll
      properties, &lt;START&gt; replaced the start time for the note, &lt;DUR&gt;
      replaced with the duration of the note, and &lt;FREQ&gt; replaced with either
      a frequency or PCH value, depending on how the Piano Roll is configured in its
      properties. The other values will pass through as part of the note.
    </para>

    <warning>
      <title>Warning</title>

      <para>
        Caution should be used when creating a Note Template string to make sure 
        that there are enough spaces allowed between replacement strings. For 
        example, the following:
      </para>

      <programlisting>i&lt;INSTR_ID&gt; &lt;START&gt; &lt;DUR&gt; &lt;FREQ&gt; &lt;FREQ&gt; 0 1 1
      </programlisting>

      <para>
        would result in:
      </para>

      <programlisting>i1 0 2 440 440 0 1 1
      </programlisting>

      <para>
        while the following:
      </para>

      <programlisting>i&lt;INSTR_ID&gt; &lt;START&gt; &lt;DUR&gt; &lt;FREQ&gt;&lt;FREQ&gt; 0 1 1
      </programlisting>

      <para>
        which does not have proper space between the two &lt;FREQ&gt; tags, results in:
      </para>

      <programlisting>i1 0 2 440440 0 1 1
      </programlisting>

    <title>Piano Roll Properties</title>

    <para>
      The PianoRoll requires a bit of configuration before using. The properties
      page below shows the properties that should be configure before using the

            template string when created and edits to the note's string stay with the
            note. Generally, you'll want to create a template string that will match the

            The scale used with this PianoRoll. The PianoRoll defaults to a 12-TET scale,
            the "standard" scale in use in Western classical and popular music. Pressing
            the button labeled "..." will open a file browser for selecting Scala scales
            to use in place of the default. After selecting a scale, the PianoRoll will
            adjust the note canvas for the number of scale degrees the newly selected
            scale contains.

                    Value of note expressed in Blue PCH, a format similar to Csound PCH but
                    differs in that it does not allow fractional values.  Values are generated
                    as "octave.scaleDegree" i.e. "8.22" would be octave 8 and scale degree 22
                    in a scale that has 23 or more notes, or would wrap around as it does in
                    Csound PCH.  If the scale had 12 scale degrees, the "8.22" would be
                    interpreted as "9.10".  Blue PCH is allowed as an option to be used with
                    Blue PCH note processors and then to be used with the Tuning NoteProcessor.

                    The display for the editor will automatically switch to show octaves and
                    notes for standard MIDI scale values.  Using MIDI note values is useful
                    for instruments that exepct MIDI note values such as the fluidsynth opcodes
                    as well as midiout.

    <title>Using the Note Canvas</title>

    <para>To enter notes, hold down the shift key and press the left mouse button down on the canvas.
      A note will be entered where you pressed and will be set to resize as you move the mouse around.
      When you finally release the mouse, the note will be finished entering.
    </para>

    <para>After that, you can select notes by clicking on them or drag and selecting notes by marquee.  You
      can also press the shift key and click on notes to add to the currently selected notes.
      You can then drag the notes around by click a selected note and dragging.  To resize a note, select
      a single note, and after hilighted, move the mouse to the right edge of the selected now, and then
      click and drag.
    </para>

    <para>To remove a note or notes, select the notes, then press the del key.</para>

    <para>To cut or copy a note, select a single note (only one note in the buffer is currently
      supported), then press ctrl-x or ctrl-c to cut or copy, respectively.
    </para>

    <para>To paste, ctrl-click on the PianoNote canvas. (This is the same behavior as pasting
      soundObjects on the main score timeline.)
    </para>

    <para>To edit a note's template, select a single note. After selecting a note,
      the text field for editing the note's template text will be enabled.  Here
      you can then edit the note's values.
