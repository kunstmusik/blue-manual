<para>Parameters: pfield, baseFrequency, scalaFile </para>
         
<para>Converts Blue PCH notation to frequency according to scale values in a 
Scala scale file. The scale will default to 12TET wheen TuningProcessor is initially
created. The file selector for choosing a Scala .scl file will default to user's .blue directory, under the scl
subdirectory.  It is advised that users download the 3000+ scale archive from
the Scala website at: http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/ and place them in
the .blue/scl directory or whever they find convenient.</para>
  
<para> Base frequency determines what 8.00 should be set to, defaulting to
middle-C below A440 (same as in Scala). Input for the noteProcessor should
be:</para>
  
<programlisting>
oct.scaleDegree
</programlisting>

<para>where oct is equal to octave, and scale degree equal to what degree of the
scale to use. The output will be frequency values, so instruments should be set
to accept values as frequency.</para>

<listitem><para>For the scaleDegree, the Blue PCH does not work exactly like Csound pch notation. In
Csound pch, &quot;8.01&quot; would be different than &quot;8.1&quot;, while for the Tuning
processor, there is no difference. The tuning processor takes everything from
the right side of the decimal and converts that to an integer to figure out the
scale degree. </para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If you enter in a scale degree higher than the number degrees in the
scale, it will be converted as if the octave is raised. For example, in a 19
tone scale, an input of &quot;8.21&quot; would get converted to &quot;9.1&quot;.
