<title>NoteProcessors</title>

<para>NoteProcessors are used in conjunction with soundObjects, and are used
post-generation of the soundObject's noteList. They are used to modify values
within the noteList.</para>

<para>NoteProcessors can be added via the soundObject property dialog. When a
soundObject is selected on the timeline, and if the soundObject supports
noteProcessors, you can add, remove, push up, or push down noteProcessors on the
property dialog.</para>

<simplesect>
<title>Role in Score Generation</title>

<para>NoteProcessors are applied after the notes of the soundObject are
generated and before time behavior is applied. Processing starts with the first
NoteProcessor in the chain and the results of that are passed down the
chain.</para>
