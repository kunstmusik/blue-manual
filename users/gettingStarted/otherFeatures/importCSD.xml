  <title>Importing ORC/SCO and CSD Files</title>

  <para>
    Blue is able to import ORC/SCO and CSD files and set up a Blue project file,
    with instruments parsed out and put into the orchestra manager, project
    settings set, etc. Currently, there are three options to choose from when
    importing a CSD file, all relating to how you would like to import the notes
    from the CsScore section:

      <para>
        Import Score to Global Score - all score goes to the Global Score
        section
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        Import All Score to Single SoundObject - all score goes into a single
        GenericScore SoundObject. The duration of the soundObject will be set to
        the duration of the imported score. This is broken up into different
        soundObjects and layers if sections (s-statement) are found in the
        score.
      </para>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        Import Score and Split into SoundObjects by Instrument Number - score is
        split by instrument number and a different GenericScore soundObject will
        be created for each block of score text per instrument. This is broken
        up into different soundObjects and layers if sections (s-statement) are
        found in the score.
